# Steel-Energy-Consumption-Prediction

The [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Steel+Industry+Energy+Consumption+Dataset) retrieved from UCI's machine learning repository. 
I have used Random Forest and XGBoost Regressors in order to predict the energy consumption for the DAEWOO Steel Co. This project is based on Sathishkumar's V E, research.

The results of the models was impresive and the first thought was the presence of overfitting, after an investigation I realized that the data structure was responsible for high scores. High data quality matters!
